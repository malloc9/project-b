# Dashboard Overview Navigation - Accessibility Verification Guide

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for manually verifying the accessibility compliance and user experience of the dashboard overview navigation feature.

## Prerequisites

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the dashboard page: `http://localhost:5173/`
3. Have a screen reader available (NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver)
4. Test with keyboard only (no mouse)

## 1. Keyboard Navigation Tests

### 1.1 Tab Navigation Through Overview Cards

**Test Steps:**
1. Load the dashboard page
2. Press `Tab` to navigate through the page
3. Verify that focus moves through all four overview cards in logical order:
   - Plants Tracked → Active Projects → Pending Tasks → This Week

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All overview cards are focusable with Tab key
- ✅ Focus moves in logical left-to-right, top-to-bottom order
- ✅ Focus indicators are clearly visible on each card
- ✅ No focus traps or inaccessible elements

### 1.2 Enter Key Activation

**Test Steps:**
1. Tab to each overview card
2. Press `Enter` key when focused on each card
3. Verify navigation occurs (or would occur in a real implementation)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Enter key activates navigation for all cards
- ✅ Cards behave as proper links
- ✅ No JavaScript errors occur

### 1.3 Focus Management

**Test Steps:**
1. Tab through the overview cards
2. Use `Shift+Tab` to navigate backwards
3. Verify focus remains visible and logical

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Backward navigation works correctly
- ✅ Focus indicators remain visible during navigation
- ✅ Focus order is consistent in both directions

## 2. Screen Reader Compatibility Tests

### 2.1 ARIA Labels and Descriptions

**Test Steps:**
1. Enable screen reader (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver)
2. Navigate to each overview card using screen reader navigation
3. Listen to the announced content for each card

**Expected Announcements:**
- **Plants Tracked**: "Navigate to plants tracked page. Current value: [number]. Active plants in your codex"
- **Active Projects**: "Navigate to active projects page. Current value: [number]. Projects in progress"
- **Pending Tasks**: "Navigate to pending tasks page. Current value: [number]. Tasks awaiting completion"
- **This Week**: "Navigate to this week page. Current value: [number]. Upcoming deadlines"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All cards are announced as links
- ✅ ARIA labels provide complete context
- ✅ Statistical values are clearly announced
- ✅ Descriptions provide meaningful context

### 2.2 Semantic HTML Structure

**Test Steps:**
1. Use screen reader to navigate by headings (`H` key in NVDA/JAWS)
2. Navigate by links (`K` key in NVDA/JAWS)
3. Verify proper semantic structure

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ "Overview" heading is properly announced as H2
- ✅ All overview cards are identified as links
- ✅ Heading hierarchy is logical and complete
- ✅ No missing or incorrect semantic markup

### 2.3 Statistical Data Context

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to each card with screen reader
2. Verify that numerical values have proper context
3. Check that descriptions are associated correctly

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Numbers are announced with their context (e.g., "2 plants tracked")
- ✅ Descriptions provide additional meaning
- ✅ No orphaned or confusing numerical announcements

## 3. Visual Focus Indicators Tests

### 3.1 Focus Ring Visibility

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate through cards using Tab key
2. Verify focus indicators on each card
3. Test with different browser zoom levels (100%, 150%, 200%)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Blue focus ring (2px) is visible around focused cards
- ✅ Focus ring has proper offset (2px) from card border
- ✅ Focus indicators remain visible at all zoom levels
- ✅ Focus indicators don't interfere with card content

### 3.2 High Contrast Mode

**Test Steps:**
1. Enable Windows High Contrast mode (or similar)
2. Navigate through cards with keyboard
3. Verify focus indicators remain visible

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Focus indicators adapt to high contrast mode
- ✅ Cards remain distinguishable from background
- ✅ Text remains readable in high contrast

## 4. Hover States and Visual Feedback Tests

### 4.1 Mouse Hover Effects

**Test Steps:**
1. Hover over each overview card with mouse
2. Observe visual changes
3. Move mouse away and verify return to normal state

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Cards show subtle shadow increase on hover
- ✅ Cards show slight scale increase (1.02x) on hover
- ✅ Hover effects are smooth with 200ms transition
- ✅ Cursor changes to pointer on interactive cards

### 4.2 Hover vs Focus States

**Test Steps:**
1. Compare hover effects with focus effects
2. Verify both states can coexist
3. Test hover while element is focused

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Hover and focus states are visually distinct
- ✅ Both states can be active simultaneously
- ✅ No visual conflicts between hover and focus

## 5. Color and Contrast Tests

### 5.1 Color Accessibility

**Test Steps:**
1. Verify each card's color scheme:
   - Plants Tracked: Green theme
   - Active Projects: Blue theme
   - Pending Tasks: Purple theme
   - This Week: Indigo theme
2. Check contrast ratios using browser dev tools or online tools

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 minimum)
- ✅ Icon backgrounds provide sufficient contrast
- ✅ Focus indicators meet contrast requirements
- ✅ Colors are not the only way to distinguish cards

### 5.2 Color Blindness Testing

**Test Steps:**
1. Use color blindness simulation tools
2. Test with different types of color blindness
3. Verify cards remain distinguishable

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Cards are distinguishable without relying on color alone
- ✅ Icons and text provide alternative identification methods
- ✅ Information is not lost in color blind simulations

## 6. Responsive Accessibility Tests

### 6.1 Mobile Viewport Testing

**Test Steps:**
1. Resize browser to mobile viewport (375px width)
2. Test keyboard navigation on mobile
3. Verify touch accessibility

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Cards remain accessible at mobile sizes
- ✅ Touch targets are at least 44px × 44px
- ✅ Focus indicators work on touch devices
- ✅ Cards stack properly on small screens

### 6.2 Zoom Testing

**Test Steps:**
1. Test at 100%, 150%, 200%, and 400% zoom

3. Check for horizontal scrolling issues

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All content remains accessible at high zoom levels
- ✅ No content is cut off or becomes unreachable
- ✅ Focus indicators scale appropriately
- ✅ Cards reflow properly at different zoom levels

## 7. Error States and Edge Cases

2. Verify accessibility is maintained
3. Check screen reader announcements

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Zero values are announced clearly
- ✅ Cards remain interactive with zero values
- ✅ No accessibility features are lost

### 7.2 Large Numbers Testing

**Test Steps:**
1. Test with large statistical values
2. Verify proper formatting and announcement
3. Check for layout issues

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Large numbers are formatted appropriately
- ✅ Screen readers announce large numbers clearly
- ✅ Card layouts accommodate large values

## 8. Performance and Loading
