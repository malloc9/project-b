# Product Guidelines

## 1. Tone and Voice

The application will communicate with users in a **minimalist and direct** tone. The language used should be clear, concise, and focused on efficiency, avoiding unnecessary jargon or embellishment. The goal is to get information to the user as quickly and unobtrusively as possible.

## 2. Visual Identity

The visual design will be **professional and understated**. The aesthetic will be guided by a subtle and elegant feel, prioritizing a clean and organized user interface. The color palette will be muted, and typography will be chosen for its clarity and readability. The overall impression should be one of calm competence.
