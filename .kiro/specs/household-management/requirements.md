# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive property and household management application. The application will be a responsive web application running on Firebase free tier with simple authentication, designed to help users manage their plants, household projects, and tasks with integrated calendar functionality.

## Requirements

4. WHEN a user adds a plant description THEN the system SHALL store and display the description with the plant entry
5. WHEN a user creates a scheduled task for a plant THEN the system SHALL store the task with due date and recurrence options
6. WHEN a plant care task is due THEN the system SHALL display it in the built-in calendar with appropriate notifications

### Requirement 2: Project Management

6. WHEN all subtasks are completed THEN the system SHALL automatically mark the parent project as eligible for completion

### Requirement 3: Simple Task Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage simple standalone tasks that don't require full project structure, so that I can quickly track smaller household activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN a user views task lists THEN the system SHALL display tasks sorted by due date and priority

### Requirement 4: Built-in Calendar Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my plant care tasks, project deadlines, and simple tasks automatically displayed in a built-in calendar, so that I receive timely notifications and can see everything in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any task or project deadline is created THEN the system SHALL automatically display a corresponding calendar event
2. WHEN a task due date is modified THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding calendar event
3. WHEN a task is completed THEN the system SHALL update the calendar event status
4. WHEN a due date approaches THEN the system SHALL provide in-app notifications
5. IF calendar display fails THEN the system SHALL provide error feedback and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 5: User Authentication

5. IF a user forgets their password THEN the system SHALL provide a password reset mechanism

### Requirement 6: Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the application on both desktop monitors and mobile phones with an optimized experience, so that I can manage my household tasks from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on a desktop monitor THEN the system SHALL display a full-featured interface optimized for large screens
2. WHEN a user accesses the application on a mobile phone THEN the system SHALL display a touch-optimized interface with appropriate sizing
3. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt the layout and navigation
4. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets and gestures
5. WHEN viewing on any device THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality across all screen sizes

### Requirement 7: Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my data to be reliably stored and retrieved, so that I don't lose my plant information, projects, and tasks.
