# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing critical TypeScript module resolution and import errors in the household management application. The application is experiencing runtime errors where TypeScript modules cannot resolve exports correctly, preventing the application from running properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Module Resolution Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript modules to resolve their imports correctly, so that the application can run without module resolution errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN all TypeScript modules SHALL resolve their imports without errors
2. WHEN importing types from the main types index THEN the system SHALL provide all exported interfaces correctly
3. WHEN importing from service modules THEN the system SHALL resolve all dependencies without circular dependency issues
4. WHEN the development server runs THEN there SHALL be no "does not provide an export" errors
5. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN all import statements SHALL resolve successfully

### Requirement 2: Type System Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent type imports across all modules, so that there are no conflicting or missing type definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing error types THEN the system SHALL use the correct import paths without circular dependencies
2. WHEN importing core types THEN the system SHALL provide consistent access to Plant, Project, Task, and other interfaces
3. WHEN using type constructors THEN the system SHALL use proper factory functions instead of interface constructors
4. WHEN modules reference shared types THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent type definitions across all files
5. WHEN TypeScript strict mode is enabled THEN all type imports SHALL comply with verbatimModuleSyntax requirements

### Requirement 3: Import Path Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized import paths for all type definitions, so that modules can reliably access the types they need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing error-related types THEN the system SHALL import from the dedicated errors module
2. WHEN importing core entity types THEN the system SHALL import from the main types index
3. WHEN importing utility types THEN the system SHALL use consistent import patterns across all modules
4. WHEN refactoring imports THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing code
5. WHEN adding new types THEN the system SHALL follow established import path conventions
