# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds internationalization (i18n) support to the application with a language selection dropdown. The application will support Hungarian and English languages, with Hungarian as the default language. All user-facing text, labels, messages, and content will be translatable and dynamically switched based on the user's language preference.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select my preferred language from a dropdown menu, so that I can use the application in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a language selection dropdown in the header or navigation area
2. WHEN a user clicks the language dropdown THEN the system SHALL show available language options (Hungarian and English)
3. WHEN a user selects a language THEN the system SHALL immediately update all visible text to the selected language
4. WHEN a user selects a language THEN the system SHALL persist the language preference in local storage
5. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL load their previously selected language preference

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Hungarian user, I want the application to default to Hungarian language, so that I can immediately use it without additional configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the application for the first time THEN the system SHALL display all content in Hungarian by default
2. WHEN no language preference is stored THEN the system SHALL use Hungarian as the fallback language
3. WHEN the browser language is detected as Hungarian THEN the system SHALL maintain Hungarian as the default

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all application text to be properly translated, so that I can fully understand and navigate the interface in my chosen language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying any user interface element THEN the system SHALL show translated text for buttons, labels, headings, and navigation items
2. WHEN displaying form validation messages THEN the system SHALL show translated error and success messages
3. WHEN displaying data tables or lists THEN the system SHALL show translated column headers and status labels
4. WHEN displaying modal dialogs or notifications THEN the system SHALL show translated content
5. WHEN displaying date and time information THEN the system SHALL format according to the selected language locale

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a structured translation system, so that I can easily add new translations and maintain existing ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new translatable text THEN the system SHALL use a consistent key-based translation structure
2. WHEN a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL display the key or fallback to English text
3. WHEN loading translations THEN the system SHALL efficiently load only the required language files
4. IF a translation is missing for the selected language THEN the system SHALL fallback to English translation
5. WHEN the application builds THEN the system SHALL validate that all translation keys are present in both languages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language selection to be accessible, so that I can use it with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL allow focus and selection of the language dropdown using Tab and Enter keys
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL announce the current language and available options
3. WHEN the language changes THEN the system SHALL announce the language change to assistive technologies
4. WHEN displaying the language dropdown THEN the system SHALL include proper ARIA labels and roles
5. WHEN the language dropdown is focused THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual focus indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language change to be seamless, so that my current context and data are preserved when switching languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL maintain the current page and user context
2. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL preserve form data and user inputs
3. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL maintain scroll position and UI state
4. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL update the page title and meta information
5. WHEN switching languages on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive layout and functionality
