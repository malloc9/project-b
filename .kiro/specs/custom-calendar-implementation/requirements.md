# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing the existing Google Calendar integration from the household management application and replacing it with a custom, self-contained calendar system. The new calendar will provide all the scheduling and reminder functionality currently handled by Google Calendar, but will be fully integrated into the application without external dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Google Calendar Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work independently without requiring Google Calendar access, so that I have full control over my data and don't need external service dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to connect to Google Calendar API
2. WHEN a user creates tasks or projects THEN the system SHALL NOT export events to Google Calendar
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL NOT require Google Calendar API credentials or permissions
4. WHEN existing users access the application THEN the system SHALL continue to function without Google Calendar dependencies
5. IF there are existing calendar integrations THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle their removal without data loss

### Requirement 2: Custom Calendar View

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my tasks, projects, and plant care activities in a built-in calendar interface, so that I can see my schedule at a glance without leaving the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the calendar page THEN the system SHALL display a monthly calendar view
2. WHEN a user views the calendar THEN the system SHALL show all tasks, project deadlines, and plant care activities as calendar events
3. WHEN a user clicks on a calendar date THEN the system SHALL display all events for that day
4. WHEN a user clicks on a calendar event THEN the system SHALL show event details and allow editing
5. WHEN a user navigates between months THEN the system SHALL load and display events for the selected time period
6. WHEN events overlap on the same day THEN the system SHALL display them in a clear, organized manner

### Requirement 3: Event Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create, edit, and delete calendar events directly in the application, so that I can manage my schedule without external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a task, project, or plant care activity THEN the system SHALL automatically create a corresponding calendar event
2. WHEN a user updates a task due date THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding calendar event
3. WHEN a user deletes a task or project THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding calendar event
4. WHEN a user marks a task as complete THEN the system SHALL update the calendar event status accordingly
5. WHEN a user creates a recurring plant care task THEN the system SHALL generate recurring calendar events
6. WHEN a user creates a custom calendar event THEN the system SHALL allow setting title, description, date, and time

### Requirement 4: Notifications and Reminders

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications for upcoming tasks and deadlines, so that I don't miss important activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task due date approaches THEN the system SHALL display in-app notifications
2. WHEN a user has overdue tasks THEN the system SHALL highlight them prominently in the calendar and dashboard
3. WHEN a user opens the application THEN the system SHALL show a summary of today's and upcoming events
4. WHEN a plant care task is due THEN the system SHALL display it prominently on the dashboard
5. IF the browser supports notifications THEN the system SHALL offer to send browser notifications for upcoming events

### Requirement 5: Calendar Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my calendar events to be saved reliably and sync across devices, so that my schedule is always available and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calendar events are created or modified THEN the system SHALL save them to Firestore
2. WHEN a user accesses the application from different devices THEN the system SHALL display the same calendar events
3. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL cache calendar events for viewing
4. WHEN the user comes back online THEN the system SHALL sync any offline changes to the server
5. WHEN calendar data is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in real-time across all open sessions
