# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current service worker implementation uses a "cache-first" strategy that aggressively caches content, preventing users from receiving the latest version of the app on their mobile devices. This creates a poor user experience where updates are not immediately available, and users may see stale content even after new deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to always receive the latest version of the app when I open it, so that I can access new features and bug fixes immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is opened THEN the service worker SHALL check for updates before serving cached content
2. WHEN a new version is available THEN the service worker SHALL download and activate it automatically
3. WHEN the app loads THEN it SHALL display the most recent version within 5 seconds of opening

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work offline with cached content, so that I can still use basic functionality when I don't have internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is offline THEN the service worker SHALL serve cached content as fallback
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the service worker SHALL provide cached alternatives
3. WHEN the user comes back online THEN the service worker SHALL sync any pending operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the service worker to use a "network-first" caching strategy for the main app bundle, so that users get fresh content while maintaining offline capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving HTML, CSS, and JS files THEN the service worker SHALL attempt network fetch first
2. IF network fetch fails THEN the service worker SHALL serve from cache as fallback
3. WHEN network fetch succeeds THEN the service worker SHALL update the cache with fresh content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be notified when app updates are available, so that I can choose when to refresh to get the latest version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new service worker version is detected THEN the app SHALL show an update notification
2. WHEN the user clicks the update notification THEN the app SHALL activate the new version and reload
3. WHEN updates are applied THEN the user SHALL see the changes immediately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper cache versioning and cleanup, so that old cached content doesn't interfere with new versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new service worker version is installed THEN it SHALL use a new cache version identifier
2. WHEN activating a new service worker THEN it SHALL delete old cache versions
3. WHEN cache cleanup occurs THEN it SHALL preserve only the current version's cache
