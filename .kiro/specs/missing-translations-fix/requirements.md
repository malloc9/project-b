# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The household management application currently has incomplete internationalization support. While basic translation infrastructure exists with English and Hungarian language files, many user-facing text strings throughout the application are hardcoded in English and not using the translation system. This creates a poor user experience for non-English speakers and prevents the application from being truly multilingual.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a non-English speaking user, I want all user interface text to be properly translated, so that I can use the application in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches to Hungarian language THEN all visible text in the application SHALL be displayed in Hungarian
2. WHEN a user switches to English language THEN all visible text in the application SHALL be displayed in English
3. WHEN the application loads THEN no hardcoded English text SHALL be visible to users who have selected a non-English language
4. WHEN new text is added to the application THEN it SHALL use the translation system rather than hardcoded strings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete translation key structure, so that I can easily add new translatable content without missing any categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining translation files THEN all major application sections SHALL have corresponding translation namespaces
2. WHEN adding new features THEN developers SHALL have clear translation key patterns to follow
3. WHEN translation keys are missing THEN the application SHALL display a fallback value rather than breaking
4. WHEN translation files are updated THEN both English and Hungarian versions SHALL be kept in sync

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want calendar and date-related text to be properly localized, so that I can understand scheduling information in my language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing calendar components THEN all labels, headers, and status text SHALL be translated
2. WHEN viewing date formats THEN they SHALL follow the selected language's conventions
3. WHEN viewing time-related text like "Today", "Tomorrow", "Overdue" THEN they SHALL be displayed in the selected language
4. WHEN viewing event types and statuses THEN they SHALL be translated appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want form elements and validation messages to be translated, so that I can understand how to interact with the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing form labels and placeholders THEN they SHALL be displayed in the selected language
2. WHEN form validation errors occur THEN error messages SHALL be shown in the selected language
3. WHEN viewing button text and actions THEN they SHALL be translated appropriately
4. WHEN viewing form instructions or help text THEN they SHALL be localized

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want error messages and system feedback to be translated, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system errors occur THEN error messages SHALL be displayed in the selected language
2. WHEN loading states are shown THEN loading text SHALL be translated
3. WHEN success messages appear THEN they SHALL be in the selected language
4. WHEN accessibility text (screen reader content) is present THEN it SHALL be translated
