- [x] 2. Update dashboard tests to reflect removed section
  - Modify existing DashboardPage tests to not expect getting started section
  - Add test to verify getting started section is not rendered
  - Ensure tests for stats overview and recent activity sections still pass
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 3. Clean up unused translation keys
  - Remove getting started related translation keys from English translation files
  - Remove getting started related translation keys from Hungarian translation files
  - Verify no other components reference the removed translation keys
