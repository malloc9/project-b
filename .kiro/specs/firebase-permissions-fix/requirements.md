# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses Firebase permissions errors that occur when accessing calendar events in the dashboard. Users are experiencing "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors when the application tries to load upcoming events, preventing the dashboard from displaying proper statistics and calendar information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want the dashboard to load my upcoming events without permission errors, so that I can see accurate statistics about my scheduled activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated and navigates to the dashboard THEN the system SHALL successfully query their calendar events without permission errors
2. WHEN the getUpcomingEvents function is called with a valid user ID THEN the system SHALL return the user's upcoming events from their subcollection
3. WHEN there are authentication timing issues THEN the system SHALL wait for proper authentication before making Firestore queries
4. WHEN Firestore rules are evaluated THEN the system SHALL have proper user context to allow read access to the user's own calendar events

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling for authentication and permissions, so that users get meaningful feedback when access issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is not yet complete THEN the system SHALL wait or retry the query instead of failing immediately
2. WHEN permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages distinguishing between authentication and authorization issues
3. WHEN network issues cause query failures THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide appropriate user feedback
4. WHEN debugging permission issues THEN the system SHALL log sufficient information to identify the root cause

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent data access patterns across the application, so that all features work reliably with the same authentication state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any user-specific data THEN the system SHALL use consistent authentication checks and user ID validation
2. WHEN multiple components access calendar data THEN the system SHALL use the same query patterns and permission model
3. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL ensure authentication state is properly established before making data queries
4. WHEN switching between different data types (plants, projects, tasks, events) THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent access patterns
