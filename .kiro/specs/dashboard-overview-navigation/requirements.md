# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the dashboard user experience by merging the Overview and QuickActions sections. The Overview section will maintain its current statistical display while becoming clickable for direct navigation to corresponding pages. The separate QuickActions section will be removed to create a cleaner, more streamlined dashboard interface that reduces redundancy and improves user workflow efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on Overview cards to navigate directly to the corresponding pages, so that I can quickly access specific sections without scrolling to find separate quick action buttons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the "Plants Tracked" overview card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the /plants page
2. WHEN a user clicks on the "Active Projects" overview card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the /projects page  
3. WHEN a user clicks on the "Pending Tasks" overview card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the /tasks page
4. WHEN a user clicks on the "This Week" overview card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the /calendar page
5. WHEN a user hovers over any overview card THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the card is clickable
6. IF a user is using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL allow tab navigation to overview cards and enter key activation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the QuickActions section removed from the dashboard, so that I have a cleaner interface without duplicate navigation options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the dashboard THEN the system SHALL NOT display the "Quick Actions" section heading
2. WHEN a user loads the dashboard THEN the system SHALL NOT display any QuickActionCard components
3. WHEN the QuickActions section is removed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing and layout of remaining dashboard sections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Overview cards to maintain their current statistical information while gaining navigation functionality, so that I don't lose any existing dashboard insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the Overview section THEN the system SHALL display the same statistical data as before (plant count, project count, pending task count, upcoming items count)
2. WHEN a user views the Overview section THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual design (icons, colors, descriptions) as the current stats cards
3. WHEN a user views the Overview section THEN the system SHALL keep the "Overview" section heading unchanged
4. WHEN overview cards become clickable THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing card styling and layout

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the navigation functionality to be accessible and follow web standards, so that all users can effectively use the enhanced overview cards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN overview cards are made clickable THEN the system SHALL implement proper ARIA labels for screen readers
2. WHEN overview cards are made clickable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate cursor styling (pointer cursor on hover)
3. WHEN overview cards are made clickable THEN the system SHALL maintain keyboard accessibility with proper focus indicators
4. WHEN overview cards are made clickable THEN the system SHALL use semantic HTML elements appropriate for navigation
